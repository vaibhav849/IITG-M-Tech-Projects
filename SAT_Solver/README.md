To run code use jupyter notebooks the ipynb file and input file should be in same folder. While running cells in jupyter notebook it will ask for name of input file and output file from user. After entering input and output file code will complete execution and load ouput of code in output file.
To run python file use this command :

```python3 Solver.py```

```Enter Input File: sat3.cnf```

```Enter Output File: sat3_output.txt```
